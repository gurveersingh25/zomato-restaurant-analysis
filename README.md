# 🍽️ Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Zomato's restaurant dataset to uncover key insights into restaurant trends, cuisines, ratings, and pricing patterns. The goal is to provide actionable insights about customer preferences and market trends using **Python** and data visualization techniques.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The dataset is **not shared** publicly due to privacy concerns. All analysis is conducted on a real-world Zomato dataset.

This EDA was implemented using **Python**, with libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, providing clean, interpretable visualizations.

## 📁 Dataset Information
The dataset includes information on thousands of restaurants, including:

- Restaurant names and locations (cities, countries)
- Types of cuisines offered
- Average cost for two
- Ratings and votes
- Online delivery and booking options
- Restaurant types (Café, Quick Bites, etc.)

> ⚡ **Privacy:** The dataset contains sensitive business information and is therefore not included in this repository. Only anonymized insights and visualizations are available.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the data to remove inconsistencies
- Analyze the distribution of ratings, cuisines, and costs
- Identify the most popular restaurant types and cuisines
- Visualize trends in pricing and ratings by location
- Highlight the top-rated restaurants and countries

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Data visualization

---

## 📈 Key Features
- Interactive and visually appealing charts  
- Detailed analysis of cuisines, ratings, and cost patterns  
- Top restaurant ranking by city and country
